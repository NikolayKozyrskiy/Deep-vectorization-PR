<b>1. Problem statement</b>

We have 2 repositories with 15 branches of research code on ECCV 2020 paper and also partly refactored from it, Github repository with more than 25000 lines of code. The goal for this project is to make an easily reproducible repository.


<b> 2.Main challenges</b>

Make an easily readable and reproducible code from a big chunk of code written in a hurry and in different branches that are not compatible. Another challenge is to make documentation for a code.

3.Description of a baseline solution. Some other implementations which will serve as inspiration or baseline for your work
  3.1. Pros and cons of these solutions
  3.2. Your ideas on how to improve it or how you are going to use it.

4. Roles for the participants
We decided that to make division fair all participants would do an equal amount of work.
