<b> 1. Problem statement</b>

We have 2 repositories with 15 branches of research code from  ECCV2020 paper Deep vectorization of technical drawings,
in also partly refactored from it, Github repository with more than 25000 lines of code.
The goal of this project is to make an easily reproducible repository(continue upgrading existing) and good documentation.


<b> 2.Main challenges</b>

Make an easily readable and reproducible code from a big chunk of code written in a hurry and in different branches that
are not compatible. Another challenge is to make documentation for a code.

<b>3.Description of a baseline solution. Some other implementations which will serve as
inspiration or baseline for your work</b>
The baseline solution is to release initial code(code form submission) without refactoring with all branches, another solution is to live the already refactored repository as it is without adding Jupiter notebooks, pretrained model, and documentations.
<b>3.1. Pros and cons of these solutions  </b>
1. Releasing research repositories:
      Pros: All raw code would be available to anyone. All models and trained
      Cons: Code is a research mess, where almost nobody would
2. Keeping refactored repository as it is
      Pros: Not spending any time
      Cons: Some functionality are missing(No good documentation, no docker file, and e.t.c. for
      more detail look at https://github.com/Vahe1994/Deep-Vectorization-of-Technical-Drawings ) 
<b> 3.2. Your ideas on how to improve it or how you are going to use it.</b>
      Add Jupiter notebooks with an explanation of how to evaluate functions, add dockerfile, and a list of requirements. Add trained models and documentations.
      For more details look at Tasks cells in google docs.
<b>4. Roles for the participants</b>
Because this team consists of only one member, all proposed tasks would be done by me. It includes writing project reports and documentation.
